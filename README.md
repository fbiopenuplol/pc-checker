# Privacy Policy

## Last updated: 30/01/2025

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, protect, and handle information when you run our system integrity and environment verification software (“Real Futbol League PC Checker”).

Our goal is to verify the **trustworthiness of a device environment** while **minimizing personal data collection** and **maximizing privacy protection.**

## 1. Purpose of Data Collection
The Software is designed to:
Assess system integrity and environment authenticity
Detect conditions that may compromise fairness, security, or trust
Prevent abuse, automation, virtualization misuse, or unauthorized modification
All data collection is strictly limited to what is necessary to perform these functions.
The Software may collect technical and environmental information about the device it runs on.
This information is used only to assess environment consistency and integrity, not to identify you personally.

## 2.1 Software & Environment Signals
Presence of software components relevant to system trust
Execution history indicators required for integrity analysis
Security configuration states (e.g. protections enabled/disabled)
**The Software does not read personal documents, private messages, photos, or unrelated application data.**

## 2.2 Network & Connectivity Signals
Limited network-related metadata strictly necessary to:
Communicate securely with our servers
Detect abuse patterns or environment manipulation
**No browsing history, traffic contents, or credentials are collected.**

## 2.3 Identifiers
Pseudonymous technical identifiers may be generated to:
Prevent repeated abuse
Maintain system reputation integrity

These identifiers are:
Derived from non-personal system attributes
Cryptographically transformed
Not reversible into personal identity

## 3. What We Explicitly Do Not Collect
**We do NOT collect:**
Names, emails, phone numbers, or addresses
Account passwords or authentication credentials
Personal files or file contents
Keystrokes, typed text, or communications
Audio, video, webcam, or microphone data
Location data beyond coarse regional routing required for networking

## 4. How Data Is Used
Collected data is used solely to:
Determine whether the environment meets integrity requirements
Detect tampering, abuse, or manipulation attempts
Generate trust or risk assessments
Improve detection accuracy and system reliability
**Data is never used for advertising, profiling, or resale.**

## 5. How Your Privacy Is Protected
We apply multiple safeguards to protect your privacy:

## 5.1 Data Minimization
Only data strictly required for integrity assessment is collected
No continuous background monitoring beyond active execution

## 5.2 Secure Transmission
All data is transmitted using encrypted communication channels (HTTPS/TLS)
No plaintext transmission of collected information

## 5.3 No Local Persistence
The Software does not permanently store collected data on your device
Data exists only transiently during execution

## 5.4 Pseudonymization & Hashing
Technical identifiers are cryptographically transformed
Raw hardware values are not stored in identifiable form

## 5.5 Access Control
Data access is restricted to authorized systems
Automated processing only; no casual human access

## 6. Data Retention
Collected data is retained only as long as necessary for security, integrity, and abuse prevention purposes
Retention periods are minimized and periodically reviewed
Obsolete or no-longer-needed data is securely deleted

## 7. Third-Party Access
Data is not sold, rented, or shared with third parties
Data may only be processed by infrastructure providers necessary to operate the service securely
No third-party analytics or advertising SDKs are used

## 8. User Control & Transparency
The Software runs only when explicitly executed
It does not operate silently or persistently without user action
Continued use of the Software indicates acceptance of this policy

##9. Policy Updates
This Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect:
Security improvements
Legal or regulatory changes
Privacy enhancements
Updates will be published alongside the Software.
